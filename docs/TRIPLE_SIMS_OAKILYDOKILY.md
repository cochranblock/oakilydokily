---

### Simulation 1: Clinic Manager (Hiring Coverage)

**Scenario:** Veterinary clinic needs overnight care, surgical support, or technician coverage. Evaluating Kaylie for contract or temp work.

| Step | Action | Expected | Observed |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Land on home | Clear service offering | ✓ "Veterinary professional services — kennel operations, overnight care, surgical support" |
| 2 | See service areas | Kennel, overnight, surgical | ✓ hero-stats: Kennel operations · Overnight care · Surgical support |
| 3 | See location/availability | Maryland, flexible | ✓ hero-status: "Serving Maryland · Flexible: contract, temp, part-time" |
| 4 | Verify experience | Work history, credentials | ✓ About → Services & Experience has full resume |

| 6 | Understand response time | 24–48 hours | ✓ Contact: "We typically respond within 24–48 hours" |

**Pain points:** None critical. Email-only contact; no calendar booking. Acceptable for low-volume professional services.

---

### Simulation 2: Kennel / Boarding Owner (Staffing)

**Scenario:** Boarding facility needs kennel supervisor or attendant. Wants someone with kennel operations experience.

| Step | Action | Expected | Observed |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Find kennel experience | Kennel operations, supervisor | ✓ Resume: Kennel Supervisor at Noah's Ark, Kennel Attendant |
| 2 | See scope | Daily care, meds, client communication | ✓ Resume bullets cover feeding, meds, client concerns |
| 3 | Sign waiver before engagement | Liability release | ✓ Nav: Waiver; full terms, ESIGN consent, DB persistence |
| 4 | Contact | How to reach | ✓ Email on contact and footer |
| 5 | Location | Maryland area | ✓ "Serving Maryland" in hero |

**Pain points:** None critical. Waiver flow is complete; DB roundtrip verified by tests.

---

### Simulation 3: Recruiter (Verifying Credentials)

| 4 | Contact | Email | ✓ byrdkaylie34@gmail.com |
| 5 | Download/print resume | PDF or print | ✓ About: "Print Resume" button; print styles hide nav/footer |

**Pain points:** None. Print Resume satisfies recruiter need for records.

---

### Simulation 4: Facility Owner (Signing Waiver Before Engagement)

---

### Feature Gaps (Ideal vs Current)

#### Gap 1: Waiver mobile terms height
**Ideal:** 280px on mobile (per TRIPLE_SIMS_WAIVER)  
**Current:** ✓ 280px in main.css `@media (max-width: 768px)` (fixed 2026-02-28)

#### Gap 2: No email copy to signer
**Ideal:** Signer receives confirmation email with copy or reference ID.  
**Current:** "Contact us if you need a copy."  
**Severity:** Low — deferred; manual contact acceptable for low volume.

#### Gap 3: No entity/company field on waiver
**Ideal:** "Signing on behalf of [company name]" for facility owners.  
**Current:** Single signer; terms mention "entity I represent" but form doesn't capture.  
**Severity:** Low — optional for B2B.

---

### Prioritized Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Source | Priority |
|---|----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Waiver mobile terms max-height 280px | Feature gap | ✓ Done |
| 2 | Email confirmation to signer (optional) | User story | Deferred |
| 3 | Optional "Signing on behalf of [entity]" field | User story | Deferred |

---

## Sim 3: UI/UX Analysis

**Based on:** pages.rs, waiver.rs, assets/css/main.css  
**Context:** Veterinary professional services; 8-bit animated pets; green/emerald theme (DM Sans, Fraunces)

---

### Current Implementation

- **Layout:** Hero (status, name, tagline, stats, note, CTAs), About (services-intro, team, Print Resume, resume), Contact (trust badge, micro, CTAs, note), Waiver (steps, terms, hint, form, note).
- **Nav:** OakilyDokily (brand), Home, About, Contact, Waiver. Hamburger on ≤768px.
- **Typography:** DM Sans (body), Fraunces (headings). Dark theme (--bg #0f1419, --accent #4ade80).
- **Assets:** favicon.svg, cat-loaf-anim.svg, dog-wag-anim.svg, guinea-pig-popcorn-anim.svg, cat-tuxedo-anim.svg, dog-dark-anim.svg.

---

### Findings

#### Strengths
- Clear business positioning: "Veterinary professional services."
- 8-bit pets add personality; hero-blob gradient subtle.
- Location/availability above fold: "Serving Maryland · Flexible."
- Resume full; Print Resume for recruiters.
- Skip link, focus states, semantic HTML.
- Waiver: DocuSign-style steps (Review → Sign → Complete); scroll hint; JS validation.
- Nav active state via data-page; footer nav mirrors.

#### Gaps & Recommendations

| # | Issue | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Waiver mobile terms 240px | Increase to 280px for consistency with desktop |
| 2 | .btn min-height 42px | WCAG 2.5.5 suggests 44px for touch; 42px acceptable; verify tap targets |
| 3 | Footer nav gap 1.5rem | May wrap on 320px; verify flex-wrap |
| 4 | Hero pets: 4–6 hidden on mobile | Intentional; reduces clutter ✓ |
| 5 | Print styles | Hide nav, footer, hero-bg, hero-pets ✓ |

---

### Recommendations to Implement

1. **Waiver mobile terms** — 280px (align with TRIPLE_SIMS_WAIVER).
2. **Button tap targets** — Verify 44px min on mobile; add if needed.
3. **Footer nav** — Ensure flex-wrap on narrow viewports.

---

## Sim 4: Imagery Evaluation

**Scope:** Hero pets, favicon, waiver (text-only)

---

### Findings

| Element | Expected | Current | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Favicon | Brand, SVG | favicon.svg | ✓ |
| Hero pets | 8-bit animated (cat, dog, guinea pig) | 6 SVGs, image-rendering: pixelated | ✓ |
| Hero blobs | Gradient orbs | Pure CSS, no images | ✓ |
| Waiver | Text/form | No imagery required | ✓ |
| About/Contact | No product images | Text-only | ✓ |

**Conclusion:** Imagery appropriate. Hero pets and blobs support brand without overwhelming.
